# m5-ansible
Module 5 ansible playbooks and supporting files

This package will require a variable file with two usernames and two passwords:

---
user:
  - user1
  - user2
password:
  - password1
  - password2

Any values should work (crosses fingers)
Also, this probably takes unreasonably long to run.  Sorry, it has to do with the sort of kluged together way that I'm setting up my database (requires waiting for an EC2 instance to be fully up and running).
